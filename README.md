Club Manager

Project Rationale
=================
I created this Django app as the final project for the Summer 2021 Python elective
at Auburn University (CPSC 4970). However, my inspiration for creating a club manager
came from my background as a teacher and a non-profit founder. I have managed several
clubs (chess, video game club, etc.) in my time as a teacher, as well as a larger network of
chess clubs in my area. In creating Club Manager, I was anticipating the functionality that
would be useful to myself and my peers in a real world setting. 

Accessing Club Manager

Using Club Manager
==================
Create a user account through registration, then create a club to get started.
Once in the club view, create groups and members. Members can be added as officers
to the club, and/or as players or coaches to groups. Tournaments can also be added
to clubs, and are populated with players from the groups. These models can also be
edited/deleted. 

Credits
=======
I used the book, Python Crash Course (2nd Edition), by Eric Matthes, specifically
the chapters on building a Django project. It was very helpful and informative.

Future Improvements
===================
* Continue styling the various views to give a more professional appearance.
* Add email capability so that users could be alerted to upcoming tournaments. 
* Give users the option to make their clubs discoverable to other users, allowing other users
to request to join clubs or register for upcoming tournaments. 
* Update database models to have locations connected to clubs/tournaments.
